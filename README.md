I this project an implementation of marked regular expressions is modeled in HOL to verryfy the correctness of the model.
This project also proveds an regexp librare for SML that utilizes SML code generated from the verrified model.

We base our implementaion on a description of how marked reguar expressions can be implemented in haskell in the paper: A Play on Regular Expressions by Sebastian Fischer,
Frank Huch and Thomas Wilke published as a functional pearl at ICFP 2010 (http://www-ps.
